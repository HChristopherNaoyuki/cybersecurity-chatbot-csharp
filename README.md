# Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a **Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot** designed to educate users about online safety practices. The chatbot is a console-based application that simulates real-life scenarios where users might encounter cyber threats, such as phishing, password safety, and safe browsing. It provides guidance on how to avoid common traps and stay safe online.

The chatbot is developed in **C#** and includes features such as:
- Voice greeting
- ASCII art display
- Personalized user interaction
- Basic response system for cybersecurity topics
- Input validation
- Enhanced console UI with color formatting and typing effects
